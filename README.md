# Roxie, Rubrik's Intelligent Personal Assistant

Roxie is based on a real world contribution that was developed by [Manjunath Chinni](https://github.com/manjunathchinni), a developer at Rubrik, as part of our annual Hackathon. The spirit of this event is to push the boundaries of what currently exists and explore the realm of the possible. You may have seen Roxie featured in the [Data Management Meets Artificial Intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OcGcScgzOo) video on YouTube.

Now you can construct a Roxie of your very own and explore the idea behind running a ChatBot that can interpret spoken or written words to determine intent. This project is all about learning how to construct API calls to Rubrik, build AWS Lambda functions, design an AWS Lex ChatBot, and put it all together!
